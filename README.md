### C-Binary Trees

Binary trees in C are data structures that consist of nodes, with each node having at most two child nodes. Every node in a binary tree has a left child and a right child node, except for the leaf nodes that do not have any child nodes.

In C programming, binary trees are commonly implemented using struct and pointers. Each struct represents a node, and it contains a data element and two pointers that point to the left and right child nodes.

Binary trees in C are used for a wide variety of purposes, including data organization, searching, sorting, and indexing. They are also used in the implementation of various algorithms, such as depth-first search, breadth-first search, and AVL trees.
